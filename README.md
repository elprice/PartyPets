# PartyPets
### Active pet hpp display for your whole party. Useful for multiboxing or pet parties.

Displays a text object containing each pet in the party in the format 'OwnerName - PetName: Pethpp' and attempts to align well. Will show pets that are out of range, released, or hpp 0 as DEAD.

    //lua load PartyPets
    
No addon specific commands - just all automatic for now. Invisible when there are no pets in the party.

Let me know if you have any questions or feature requests!

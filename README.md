# PartyPets
### Active pet hpp display for your whole party. Useful for multiboxing or pet parties.

Displays a text object containing each pet in the party in the format 'OwnerName - PetName: Pethpp' and attempts to right-align the hpp values. Will show pets that are out of range, released, or hpp = 0 as DEAD. 

    //lua load PartyPets
    
No addon specific commands - all automatic for now. Invisible when there are no pets in the party. Click and drag to move the addon.

Let me know if you have any questions or feature requests!
